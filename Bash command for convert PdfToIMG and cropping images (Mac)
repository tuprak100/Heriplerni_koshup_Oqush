1. Install 
macOS (using Homebrew):
If you don't have Homebrew, install it first:

''''
bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
''''

Then install ImageMagick:
''''
bash
brew install imagemagick
''''
2. Convert PDF to Images:

The first step is to convert each page of your PDF into a raster image (like PNG or TIFF). This makes it easier to work with individual words as image regions.
Tool:
ImageMagick (Command-line): A powerful and versatile command-line tool for image manipulation. Highly recommended for batch processing.
change the input to your pdf file name.
''''
convert input.pdf page_%d.png
''''

3. My pdf file has 2 columns and 4 raws, total 8 words each page. The following bash command will crop each word. 
Note, I cropped the image again to only include areas with the square (2*4).

''''
bash
# Assuming each page image is named page_N.png
page_width=$(identify -format "%w" page_0.png)
page_height=$(identify -format "%h" page_0.png)
square_width=$((page_width / 2)) # Divide by 2 for 2 columns
square_height=$((page_height / 4)) # Divide by 4 for 4 rows

for page in $(seq 0 23); do # loop through the 24 pages
  for row in $(seq 0 3); do # Loop from 0 to 3 (4 rows)
    for col in $(seq 0 1); do # Loop from 0 to 1 (2 columns)
      x=$((col * square_width))
      y=$((row * square_height))
      output_file="page_${page}_row_${row}_col_${col}.png"
      magick page_${page}.png -crop ${square_width}x${square_height}+${x}+${y} ${output_file}
    done
  done
done
